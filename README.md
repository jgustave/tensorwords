Trying to do text generation from a corpus of wine reviews

Getting closer!

- dark red, crisp. tannin, classic length. not heavy dark, strawberries and nice finish. but not fine delicious.
- dark cherry, cherry and strawberries, spice has large. good complexity.
- good burgers steak.
- fresh acidity.  earthy, vanilla, hints of cherry flavor for a results out. lemonchberry flavors core and funky on  i it match.

And a single epic poem review with the knobs set to "weird":

Hints of red fruit and a bit of minerality. not over the next day. still a bit of acidity and a bit of strawberry and licorice and pear, spice, cherry, plums and cherry, cherry and fruit and tannins. still present but still has a bit too much tannins. the legs are medium. there is no sediment in the bottle. a decent acidity and fruit and licorice and cherry and spice. very nice wine with a long finish. well balanced with some tart cherry, licorice, cherry, some smoke and smoke and cherry and some smoke and black fruit and sweet cherry and black cherry fruit and plum and spice on the palate with a bit of cherry and cherry, and sweet fruit and strawberry, chocolate and cherry, cherry and cherry and plum and a hint of hints of cherry fruit, tart cherries, and a long finish. very nice structure. not a big and smokey notes. the palate with a long finish. nice acidity and tannins are a little spice, and a little dry finish. this is a full body, medium body. still a bit too much oak and vanilla and coffee and some smoke.

What really blows my mind is that it took me 50 peta flops to generate that NN (while I slept), and it cost me a dollar.
