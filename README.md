And a single epic poem review with the knobs set to "weird":

Hints of red fruit and a bit of minerality. not over the next day. still a bit of acidity and a bit of strawberry and licorice and pear, spice, cherry, plums and cherry, cherry and fruit and tannins. still present but still has a bit too much tannins. the legs are medium. there is no sediment in the bottle. a decent acidity and fruit and licorice and cherry and spice. very nice wine with a long finish. well balanced with some tart cherry, licorice, cherry, some smoke and smoke and cherry and some smoke and black fruit and sweet cherry and black cherry fruit and plum and spice on the palate with a bit of cherry and cherry, and sweet fruit and strawberry, chocolate and cherry, cherry and cherry and plum and a hint of hints of cherry fruit, tart cherries, and a long finish. very nice structure. not a big and smokey notes. the palate with a long finish. nice acidity and tannins are a little spice, and a little dry finish. this is a full body, medium body. still a bit too much oak and vanilla and coffee and some smoke.

What really blows my mind is that it took 50 peta flop to generate that NN (while I slept), and it cost me a dollar.

** Changed to Sequence length 30, which is producing a better model. **

tasted at the way which spanish had a lot of grippy tannins. decent finish. taste is good marks abver. not bad for the money.

dark fruit still has a touch of fruit which is low acid but the flavor of a fresh white. light bodied on the palate, but present that is holding give this too light but not your gumpoint. particularly red shirah typical fruit with excellent acidity. good qpr.

deep ruby color to become balanced and integrated on the palate. complex and smooth. not much in the mouth with an incredible minerality and mouth feel. even better on the palate and full bodied and focused chard. better than expected.

great wine if not as good as a bit of the fruit with a still a bit of perfumed herbs. it is drinking really well.

light gold color. a little lemon notes with a hint of currants with hint of vanilla. the body is medium full. the wine has smooth texture. the wine finishes medium. no noticeable tannins. the beginning has a nice balance. the black berries on the finish. however i would have to open a few hours. the zin and some structure. beautiful and smooth, but also some as resolved with a bit of jasmine and acidity balanced silky and superb and deep in the mouth. nice balance, which is a lot going on. it is like a cabs, and sauce. classic scaled. can last looking for more.

light body, medium bodied and fresh. beautiful color and balanced smooth wine. beginning to come together. i would more than some bottle of it. mellowed with a hint of petrol flavors. nothing simple but overall will be fine to fine this one. dark and rich caramel nose. nothing complex and good for the price.
